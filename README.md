🔀 Git Branching Strategy

To ensure organized and clean development, multiple Git branches were used:

feature branch – Used for adding new sections such as About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.

test branch – Used to test layout changes, responsiveness, and navigation.

bugfix branch – Used to fix issues like broken links, alignment problems, and CSS errors.

experiment branch – Used for experimenting with themes, fonts, animations, and design ideas.

Only stable and successful changes were merged into the main branch.
